### City in Nature

#### We will create a green, liveable and sustainable home for Singaporeans.

- 50% more land—around 200 hectares—for **[nature parks](https://www.mnd.gov.sg/our-work/greening-our-home/greenery){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}**, meaning every household will live just a 10-minute walk from a park. 
- One million more trees will be planted across our island, which will sequester another 78,000 tonnes of CO2, providing cleaner air and more shade.
- Working with communities and NGOs to develop programmes to allow people and wildlife to live in harmony.

**Do you have ideas or suggestions on the Green Plan?**
