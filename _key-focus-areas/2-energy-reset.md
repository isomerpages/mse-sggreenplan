### Energy Reset

![Energy Reset](/images/framework/framework_energyreset.jpg)

#### We will use cleaner energy and increase our energy efficiency to lower our carbon footprint. 

**[Housing](https://www.mnd.gov.sg/our-work/greening-our-home/hdb-green-towns-programme){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}**
- Our solar energy deployment will quadruple by 2025, including covering the rooftops of HDB blocks with solar panels. By 2030, solar energy deployed will be five times that of today, with at least 2 gigawatt-peak, capable of powering over 350,000 households a year. 
- HDB towns will use 15% less energy through measures like the widespread use of smart LED lights and solar energy.
- Beyond HDB towns, we will green 80% of all buildings over the next decade. 
 

**[Transport](https://www.mot.gov.sg/news-centre/news/Detail/written-reply-by-minister-for-transport-ong-ye-kung-to-parliamentary-question-on-update-on-plan-to-provide-28-000-electric-vehicle-charging-points-by-2030/){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}**
- Our 2040 vision is to phase out internal combustion engine vehicles, and have all vehicles run on cleaner energy.
- All newly-registered cars to be cleaner-energy models by 2030.
- To support the growth of electric vehicles (EV), we will more than double our EV charger targetsâ€”from 28,000 to 60,000 by 2030.

			We will strive to use cleaner energy, and become more energy efficient.<br/><br/>
			We will quadruple our solar energy deployment by 2025, such as by covering the rooftops of HDB blocks with solar panels. We already host the largest biodiesel plant in the world, which is being further expanded.<br/><br/>

			We can also use 15% less energy in HDB towns by 2030, through measures such as the widespread use of smart LED lights and solar energy.<br/><br/>
			<i><strong>Chan Chun Sing</strong></i><br/>
			<i>Minister for Trade and Industry</i><br/><br/>
			We will invest in water research and development, to halve the energy required to produce desalinated water. Our waste treatment facilities, such as Tuas Nexus, will generate more energy than they consume.<br/><br/>
			This metropolis of ours will be a bright green spark, inspiring the world and our future generations.
