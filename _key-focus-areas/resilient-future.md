### Resilient Future

#### We are starting our preparations now to deal with climate change that will last into the next century, and building up our national resilience for the future.

#### Shoring up our coastal and flood defences

Climate change could cause mean sea-level rise of up to 1 metre by 2100 in Singapore. If there is a confluence of extreme high tides and storm surges, some projections suggest that sea levels could be as high as 4 to 5 metres. This is high enough to potentially flood one-third of Singapore.
 
It is thus important for an island city like Singapore to plan ahead and [reimagine our coastline](https://www.pub.gov.sg/Public/KeyInitiatives/Flood-Resilience/Get-Involved-for-Coastal-Protection), so we can keep our shores and our people safe.
 
To develop measures to protect Singapore from the threat of rising sea levels, here is what PUB has begun doing:
 
- Commenced the development of the Coastal-Inland Flood Model in 2021 to assess flood risks holistically.
- Studying engineering solutions with nature-based enhancements to hold back the rising seas. These include sea walls, earthen bunds, revetments and mangroves.
- Carrying out site-specific studies for vulnerable areas, starting with City-East Coast, Jurong Island and the north-west coast of Singapore.
 
#### Strengthen food security
 
As a food loving nation, we have to make our food supply more resilient. One of the ways that we do so is by growing local, as it provides an assured and regenerative source of food and serves as a buffer in times of supply disruptions. We will do this in partnership with a vibrant agri-food industry and our communities.
 
A $60 million Agri-Food Cluster Transformation (ACT) Fund has been established to to provide funding support to farms to build and expand their production capabilities and capacities. 
 
We are also looking into the expansion of sustainable fish farming in the deeper Southern Waters of Singapore and transforming the coastal fish farms in the Straits of Johor to boost local fish production.

#### Keep Singapore cool
 
Though Singapore has always been hot and humid, we don't want temperatures to be unbearably high. By increasing greenery and piloting the use of cool paint on building facades, we will moderate the rise in urban heat.
 
We will [mitigate the Urban Heat Island (UHI)](https://isomer-user-content.by.gov.sg/23/27f5cd0b-af16-417b-b9dd-3490a65b78e8/cos-resources-cos-annex-j.pdf) effect through the following ways:
- Understand the UHI effect better by deploying an island-wide network of climate sensors to collect data
- Conduct research and modelling on UHI effects, e.g. the Cooling Singapore 2.0 project
- Partner the industry and public to implement a UHI mitigation action plan, including piloting the use of cool materials and reducing human-generated heat
