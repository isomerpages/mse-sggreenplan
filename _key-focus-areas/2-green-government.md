- Set aside 1000 hectares for green spaces, of which 200 hectares will be new **[nature parks](https://www.mnd.gov.sg/our-work/greening-our-home/greenery){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}**
- Every household will live just a 10-minute walk from a park. 
- **[One million more trees](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/treessg/one-million-trees-movement){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}** will be planted across our island, which will sequester another 78,000 tonnes of CO2, providing cleaner air and more shade.
- Working with communities and NGOs to develop programmes to allow people and wildlife to live in harmony.

### Green Government

#### The public sector will lead the way to pursue sustainable development with the **GreenGov.SG** initiative.

Formerly known as the Public Sector Taking the Lead in Environmental Sustainability (PSTLES) initiative, the GreenGov.SG initiative forms a component and enabler of the recently launched Singapore Green Plan 2030. 

Introduced in 2006, the PSTLES initiative was aimed at improving resource efficiency within the public sector. In 2014, PSTLES 2.0 was enhanced to focus on sustainability outcomes and put in place organisational processes to manage resource use. (Please refer to Annex for more details on PSTLES 2.0).

This year, in line with the objectives of the Green Plan, PSTLES will be refreshed and renamed as GreenGov.SG. The name “GreenGov.SG” reflects the cross-cutting role of the Government in supporting the national sustainability agenda mapped out in the Green Plan. 

**The public service will undergo four key shifts under GreenGov.SG:**

  - First, there will be more ambitious targets, including a carbon emissions target for the first time. We aim to peak the public service’s emissions around 2025, ahead of the national target.

  - Second, the scope of GreenGov.SG will be expanded. In target setting, we will go beyond government-owned offices, to include public sector infrastructure and operations, such as transport infrastructure and healthcare facilities.

  - Third, we will embed environmental sustainability in the public service’s core business areas, for example, in areas like green procurement and education. This will raise sustainability awareness and catalyse green practices beyond the public service. 

  - Fourth, we aim to build a culture of sustainability amongst public servants. Public servants will be encouraged to adopt more environmentally-friendly practices and initiate ground-up initiatives within their agencies.  

While the public sector is taking the lead, achieving our goal of sustainable development is a whole-of-nation endeavour. With the refreshed GreenGov.SG initiative, the Government hopes to inspire our people and partners to embrace green practices and make sustainability a way of life. Together, we can chart our way towards a low-carbon and sustainable future for Singapore. 

As part of the Green Plan, GreenGov.SG will be a living plan. We will continue to refresh the specific targets, strategies and initiatives over time, as new opportunities avail themselves. More details on GreenGov.SG will be released over the course of the year.
