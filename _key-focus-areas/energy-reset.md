### Energy Reset

### Green Energy

#### Play active and important roles in fulfilling two international goals

- The International Civil Aviation Organization’s aspirational goals of 2% annual fuel efficiency improvement from now to 2050 and carbon neutral growth from 2020
- The International Maritime Organization’s target to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from international shipping by at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008 levels, and to phase out such GHG emissions in this century

#### 2030 targets:
- Increase solar energy deployment by five-fold to at least 2 GWp, which can meet around 3% of our 2030 projected electricity demand and generate enough electricity to power more than 350,000 households a year (1.5 GWp by 2025, which can meet around 2% of our 2025 projected electricity demand and generate enough electricity to power more than 260,000 households a year)
- 200 MW of energy storage systems deployment beyond 2025, which can power more than 16,000 households a day
- Best-in-class generation technology that meets heat-rate/emissions standards and reduces carbon emissions
- Diversified electricity supply with clean electricity imports

#### Greener Infrastructure and Buildings

#### 2025 targets:
- Reduce energy consumption of desalination process from current 3.5kWh/m3 to 2kWh/m3
- Singapore’s first integrated waste and used water treatment facility to be 100% energy self-sufficient (Tuas Nexus)

#### 2030 targets:
- Green 80% of Singapore’s buildings (by Gross Floor Area) by 2030
- 80% of new buildings (by Gross Floor Area) to be SLE buildings from 2030
- Best-in-class green buildings to see an 80% improvement in energy efficiency (over 2005 levels) by 2030

Long-term target: Reduce desalination energy further to 1kWh/m3


### Sustainable Towns and Districts

#### 2030 target:
- Reduce energy consumption in existing HDB towns by 15%


### Cleaner-energy Vehicles

#### 2025 targets:
- New registrations of diesel cars and taxis to cease from 2025- 
- 7 EV-Ready Towns with chargers at all HDB carparks by 2025

#### 2030 targets:
- All new car and taxi registrations to be of cleaner-energy models from 2030
- Target 60,000 charging points nationwide by 2030, including 40,000 in public carparks and 20,000 in - private premises



### EXISTING TO BE REVIEWED

#### We will use cleaner energy and increase our energy efficiency to lower our carbon footprint.

**In support of SDGs:**

**[Housing](https://www.mnd.gov.sg/our-work/greening-our-home/hdb-green-towns-programme){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}**
- Existing HDB towns will use 15% less energy through measures like the widespread use of smart LED lights and solar energy by 2030.
- We are also designing our new HDB towns to be greener and more sustainable. For example, [Tengah](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/about-us/history/hdb-towns-your-home/tengah), Singapore’s newest HDB town and our first smart and sustainable town, will have a centralised cooling system, electric vehicle charging points, and extensive deployment of solar panels.

- “80-80-80 in 2030” Targets (4th Edition of Singapore Green Building Masterplan)
- Green 80% of buildings by Gross Floor Area by 2030
- (New) 80% of new developments to be Super Low Energy (SLE) buildings from 2030
- (New) 80% improvement in energy efficiency over 2005 baseline for best-in-class green buildings by 2030

- Our 2040 vision is to phase out internal combustion engine vehicles, and have all vehicles run on cleaner energy.
<!-- We will require all newly-registered cars to be cleaner-energy models from 2030. 
To support the growth of electric vehicles (EVs), we will more than double our EV charging point target—from 28,000 to 60,000 by 2030. -->

**Green Energy**
- Our solar energy deployment will quadruple by 2025, including covering the rooftops of HDB blocks with solar panels. By 2030, solar energy deployed will be five times that of today, with at least 2 gigawatt-peak, capable of powering about 350,000 households a year. 
- Tap green energy sources from the ASEAN region and beyond, through electricity imports
- Increase efficiency with each new generation of gas-fired power plants to reduce emissions (such as through adopting new, advanced, combined-cycle gas turbines) 

<blockquote>
  <p>Depending on the results of our collective actions, and that of the international community, we will review our climate commitments, and seek to achieve net zero emissions as soon as we can. That way, we can punch above our weight, and have a positive environmental impact well beyond our shores.</p>
  <span class="author">Lawrence Wong, Minister for Education</span>
