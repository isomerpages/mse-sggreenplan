### Energy Reset

Under the Energy Reset pillar, we aim to use cleaner energy sources across all sectors.
 
#### Green Energy
 
Solar energy remains the most promising renewable energy source for Singapore when it comes to electricity generation. 
 
Our installed solar capacity has grown by more than six times over the past five years. Today, Singapore is already one of the most solar-dense cities in the world.
 
We will continue to maximise solar panel deployment, including on rooftops, reservoirs and other open spaces.
 
For example, in July 2021, Singapore officially opened the large-scale 60 megawatt-peak floating solar panel system at Tengeh Reservoir, which is about the size of 45 football fields. Our aim is to quintuple our solar energy deployment to at least 2 gigawatt-peak by 2030, equivalent to powering around 350,000 households a year.
 
We also plan to tap on regional power grids and Increase efficiency with each new generation of gas-fired power plants to reduce emissions (such as through adopting new, advanced, combined-cycle gas turbines)

#### Green Transport
 
As our transport system grows in capacity and usage, it becomes increasingly important to manage its environmental footprint. Under the Singapore Green Plan 2030, our vision is for all vehicles to run on cleaner-energy by 2030.
 
We will continue to reduce the sector's emissions by encouraging the use of public transport and active mobility and transitioning to a cleaner-energy vehicle population.
 
While we position ourselves to seize growth opportunities in aviation and maritime, we will explore ways to do so sustainably.

#### Green Buildings
 
Buildings account for over 20% of Singapore’s emissions. Greening our buildings is hence a key strategy to achieve our sustainability ambitions under the Singapore Green Plan 2030, and to fulfil our international commitments on climate change.

### EXISTING DATA

#### We will use cleaner energy and increase our energy efficiency to lower our carbon footprint.

**[Housing](https://www.mnd.gov.sg/our-work/greening-our-home/hdb-green-towns-programme){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}**
- Existing HDB towns will use 15% less energy through measures like the widespread use of smart LED lights and solar energy by 2030.
- We are also designing our new HDB towns to be greener and more sustainable. For example, [Tengah](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/about-us/history/hdb-towns-your-home/tengah), Singapore’s newest HDB town and our first smart and sustainable town, will have a centralised cooling system, electric vehicle charging points, and extensive deployment of solar panels.

- “80-80-80 in 2030” Targets (4th Edition of Singapore Green Building Masterplan)
- Green 80% of buildings by Gross Floor Area by 2030
- (New) 80% of new developments to be Super Low Energy (SLE) buildings from 2030
- (New) 80% improvement in energy efficiency over 2005 baseline for best-in-class green buildings by 2030


**[Transport](https://www.mot.gov.sg/news-centre/news/Detail/written-reply-by-minister-for-transport-ong-ye-kung-to-parliamentary-question-on-update-on-plan-to-provide-28-000-electric-vehicle-charging-points-by-2030/){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}**

<div style="background-color:#b2d4ce;">
<strong><p>(New) 2025 Targets:</p></strong>
<ul>
  <li>New registrations of diesel cars and taxis to cease from 2025</li>
  <li>8 EV-Ready Towns with chargers at all HDB carparks by 2025</li>
</ul>
<strong><p>(New) 2030 Targets:</p></strong>
<ul>
  <li>All new car and taxi registrations to be of cleaner-energy models from 2030</li>
  <li>Target 60,000 charging points nationwide by 2030, including 40,000 in public carparks and 20,000 in private premises</li>
</ul>
</div>


- Our 2040 vision is to phase out internal combustion engine vehicles, and have all vehicles run on cleaner energy.
<!-- We will require all newly-registered cars to be cleaner-energy models from 2030. 
To support the growth of electric vehicles (EVs), we will more than double our EV charging point target—from 28,000 to 60,000 by 2030. -->

**Green Energy**
- Our solar energy deployment will quadruple by 2025, including covering the rooftops of HDB blocks with solar panels. By 2030, solar energy deployed will be five times that of today, with at least 2 gigawatt-peak, capable of powering about 350,000 households a year. 
- Tap green energy sources from the ASEAN region and beyond, through electricity imports
- Increase efficiency with each new generation of gas-fired power plants to reduce emissions (such as through adopting new, advanced, combined-cycle gas turbines) 

<blockquote>
  <p>Depending on the results of our collective actions, and that of the international community, we will review our climate commitments, and seek to achieve net zero emissions as soon as we can. That way, we can punch above our weight, and have a positive environmental impact well beyond our shores.</p>
