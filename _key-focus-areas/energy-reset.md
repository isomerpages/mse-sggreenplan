### Energy Reset

#### Under the Energy Reset pillar, we aim to use cleaner energy sources across all sectors.

#### Green Energy
 
Solar energy remains the most promising [renewable energy source](https://www.ema.gov.sg/Renewable_Energy.aspx) for Singapore when it comes to electricity generation. 
 
Our installed solar capacity has grown by more than six times over the past five years. Today, Singapore is already one of the most solar-dense cities in the world.
 
We will continue to maximise solar panel deployment, including on rooftops, reservoirs and other open spaces.
 
For example, in July 2021, Singapore officially opened the large-scale 60 megawatt-peak floating solar panel system at Tengeh Reservoir, which is about the size of 45 football fields. Our aim is to quintuple our solar energy deployment to at least 2 gigawatt-peak by 2030, equivalent to powering around 350,000 households a year.
 
We also plan to tap on regional power grids and Increase efficiency with each new generation of gas-fired power plants to reduce emissions (such as through adopting new, advanced, combined-cycle gas turbines).
 
#### Green Transport
 
As our transport system grows in capacity and usage, it becomes increasingly important to manage its environmental footprint. Under the Singapore Green Plan 2030, our vision is for all vehicles to run on cleaner-energy by 2030.
 
We will continue to reduce the sector's emissions by encouraging the use of public transport and active mobility and transitioning to a cleaner-energy vehicle population.
 
While we position ourselves to seize growth opportunities in aviation and maritime, we will explore ways to do so sustainably.

#### Green Buildings
 
Buildings account for over 20% of Singaporeâ€™s emissions. [Greening our buildings](https://www.mnd.gov.sg/our-work/greening-our-home/singapore-green-building-masterplan) is hence a key strategy to achieve our sustainability ambitions under the Singapore Green Plan 2030, and to fulfil our international commitments on climate change.
