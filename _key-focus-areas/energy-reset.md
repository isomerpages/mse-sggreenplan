### Energy Reset

#### Under the Energy Reset pillar, we aim to use cleaner energy sources across all sectors.

#### Green Energy
 
[Solar energy](https://www.ema.gov.sg/energy-supply-switch-solar.aspx) remains the most promising [renewable energy](https://www.ema.gov.sg/Renewable_Energy.aspx) source for Singapore when it comes to electricity generation. 
 
Our installed solar capacity has grown by more than six times over the past five years. Today, Singapore is one of the most solar-dense cities in the world.
 
We will continue to maximise solar panel deployment, including on rooftops, reservoirs and other open spaces. Our aim is at least 2 gigawatt-peak of solar energy deployment by 2030, which can generate enough energy to meet the annual electricity needs of around 350,000 households. 

However, solar power output is intermittent in nature and is subject to weather conditions. To maintain grid reliability, Singapore is deploying [Energy Storage Systems (ESS)](https://www.ema.gov.sg/energy-storage-system.aspx) to address solar intermittency and enhance grid resilience. In February 2023, Singapore officially launched a 285 megawatt-hour ESS on Jurong Island. This is the largest ESS in Southeast Asia and was commissioned in 6 months, the fastest in the world of its size to be deployed. 

Regional power grids will allow us to access cleaner energy sources beyond our borders. We aim to import up to 4 gigawatts of low-carbon electricity by 2035, which would make up around 30% of Singapore's projected electricity supply.

Singapore is also exploring emerging low-carbon alternatives such as hydrogen, geothermal and carbon capture, utilisation and storage. In October 2022, we announced our [National Hydrogen Strategy](https://www.mti.gov.sg/Industries/Hydrogen) to develop hydrogen as a major decarbonisation pathway.

We also plan to increase the efficiency of our gas-fired power plants to reduce emissions. 
 
#### Green Transport
 
As our transport system grows in capacity and usage, it becomes increasingly important to manage its [environmental footprint](https://www.mot.gov.sg/what-we-do/green-transport). Under the Singapore Green Plan 2030, our vision is for all vehicles to run on cleaner-energy by 2030.
 
We will continue to reduce the sector's emissions by encouraging the use of public transport and active mobility and transitioning to a cleaner-energy vehicle population.
 
While we position ourselves to seize growth opportunities in aviation and maritime, we will explore ways to do so sustainably.

#### Green Buildings
 
Buildings account for over 20% of Singaporeâ€™s emissions. [Greening our buildings](https://www.mnd.gov.sg/our-work/greening-our-home/singapore-green-building-masterplan) is hence a key strategy to achieve our sustainability ambitions under the Singapore Green Plan 2030, and to fulfil our international commitments on climate change.
