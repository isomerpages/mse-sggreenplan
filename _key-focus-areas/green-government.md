#### The public sector will lead the way to pursue sustainable development with the **GreenGov.SG** initiative. 

Formerly known as the Public Sector Taking the Lead in Environmental Sustainability (PSTLES) initiative, the GreenGov.SG initiative forms a component and enabler of the Singapore Green Plan 2030. 

Introduced in 2006, the PSTLES initiative was aimed at improving resource efficiency within the public sector. In 2014, PSTLES 2.0 was enhanced to focus on sustainability outcomes and put in place organisational processes to manage resource use.

This year, in line with the objectives of the Green Plan, PSTLES has been refreshed and renamed as GreenGov.SG. The name “GreenGov.SG” reflects the cross-cutting role of the Government in supporting the national sustainability agenda mapped out in the Green Plan. 

Under GreenGov.SG, the public sector will strive to attain ambitious sustainability targets in carbon abatement and resource efficiency, and be a positive influence and enabler of green efforts. Every public officer will be encouraged and supported to embrace sustainable practices.

**GreenGov.SG has three pillars:**

a) **Excel** with new and more ambitious targets:

- The public sector aims to peak its carbon emissions around 2025, ahead of the national target.

- By 2030, the public sector aims to reduce energy<sup>1</sup> and water<sup>2</sup> use by 10 per cent from the average of 2018 - 2020 levels, and to reduce the amount of waste disposed<sup>3</sup> by 30 per cent from 2022 levels.<sup>4</sup>    

- The public sector will set targets for buildings, information technology, transport, and solar deployment that are more ambitious than the national targets.

- For all the above, the scope of GreenGov.SG will be expanded to include public sector infrastructure and operations, such as public transport infrastructure and healthcare facilities.

b) **Enable** a sustainable economy and green citizenry, by embedding sustainability in our core business:

- We will require Government agencies to purchase products that meet high efficiency or sustainability standards. This will apply to electrical appliances, as well as water fittings, building materials for interior use, and electric vehicles.

- We will factor in companies’ sustainability-related policies and practices when evaluating government tenders, starting with event venue and accommodation, and public waste collection contracts. We will work towards incorporating sustainability as a consideration in our procurement decisions.

- We will incorporate sustainability features at public spaces such as hawker centres and community clubs to raise public awareness. We will also educate our community on sustainability issues through our school curriculum and community programmes.

c) **Excite** public officers to contribute actively to sustainability in Singapore:

- There will be regular sharing sessions organised within the public sector to promote the exchange of ideas, best practices, and the latest technological solutions, so as to inspire and support public officers to champion ground-up initiatives.

- We will organise campaigns to raise awareness and encourage public officers to take simple steps to lead a more sustainable lifestyle.

As we embark on GreenGov.SG, the public sector will look to private sector leaders in the sustainability space, for innovations, best practices, and partnerships. Please refer to our [media release](../../resource-room/category/2021-07-12-press-release-on-greengov) for more details.

<!-- 
**The public service will undergo four key shifts under GreenGov.SG:**

  - First, there will be more ambitious targets, including a carbon emissions target for the first time. We aim to peak the public service’s emissions around 2025, ahead of the national target.

  - Second, the scope of GreenGov.SG will be expanded. In target setting, we will go beyond government-owned offices, to include public sector infrastructure and operations, such as transport infrastructure and healthcare facilities.

  - Third, we will embed environmental sustainability in the public service’s core business areas, for example, in areas like green procurement and education. This will raise sustainability awareness and catalyse green practices beyond the public service. 

  - Fourth, we aim to build a culture of sustainability amongst public servants. Public servants will be encouraged to adopt more environmentally-friendly practices and initiate ground-up initiatives within their agencies.   -->

While the public sector is taking the lead, achieving our goal of sustainable development is a whole-of-nation endeavour. With the refreshed GreenGov.SG initiative, the Government hopes to inspire our people and partners to embrace green practices and make sustainability a way of life. Together, we can chart our way towards a low-carbon and sustainable future for Singapore. 

As part of the Green Plan, GreenGov.SG is a living plan. We will continue to refresh the specific targets, strategies and initiatives over time, as new opportunities avail themselves. More details on GreenGov.SG will be released over the course of the year.
