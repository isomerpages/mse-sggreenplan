**GreenGov.SG Report**

The inaugural GreenGov.SG report was published in December 2023. This report provides a snapshot of the Singapore public sector’s FY2022 environmental sustainability performance. It also documents the public sector’s key strategies and initiatives to enhance environmental sustainability and meet our targets.

**View the GreenGov.SG Report [here](https://www.mse.gov.sg/files/resources/greengovsg-report-fy2022.pdf).**

The Singapore Public Sector is a member of the Net Zero Government Initiative. Participating countries commit to achieving net zero emission from national government operations no later than 2050, and develop a roadmap that outlines the pathway for achieving the net zero commitment.&nbsp;

**The Net Zero Roadmap can be found [here.](https://www.sustainability.gov/pdfs/singapore-nzgi-roadmap.pdf)**

As we progress along our sustainability journey, we will continue to learn from others, and improve our performance and plans.&nbsp;

It will require a whole-of-nation effort to achieve our national environmental sustainability goals. Together, we can chart our way towards a low-carbon and sustainable future for Singapore.
