### Sustainable Living

![Sustainable Living](/images/framework/framework_sustainableliving.jpg)

#### We will reduce carbon emissions, keep our environment clean, and make saving resources and energy a way of life in Singapore. 

**Circular Economy**  
The [circular economy](https://www.towardszerowaste.gov.sg/zero-waste-masterplan/chapter2/circular-economy/#:~:text=Unlike%20the%20linear%20economy%2C%20the,for%20as%20long%20as%20possible.&text=Adopting%20a%20circular%20economy%20approach,Resiliences%E2%80%9D%20to%20sustain%20Singapore's%20future.){:class="external-link" target="_blank"} focuses on designing waste out of the resource ecosystem and maximising the value of resources by keeping them in use for as long as possible. We aim to be a zero waste nation powered by a circular economy, with a high rate of recycling so that our precious resources can be used many times over. We have closed our water loop by recycling our used water to make NEWater, and will make a similar strong push towards circularity in waste materials to transform trash to treasure. We will also turn incinerated waste into NEWSand, to be used for construction.

**Eco Stewardship Programme**  
This will involve all MOE schools from Kindergarten to Pre-University. MOE will strengthen school curricula and programmes on sustainability. **Our aim is to achieve a two-third reduction of net carbon emissions from the schools sector by 2030, with at least 20% of schools to be carbon neutral by 2030.** 

**Green Commutes**  
We are making good progress towards achieving our goal of bringing 8 out of 10 households to being within a 10-minute walk of a train station by the 2030s. In the coming years, new stations and lines will be opened almost every year. The rail network will grow from around 230 km today to 360 km by the early 2030s.

#### Initiatives For Schools And Students

**[The Environment Fund for Schools](https://www.cgs.gov.sg/docs/default-source/Resources/efs-web-page-contenta34c09d515f061ce946dff0000c37214.pdf){:class="external-link" target="_blank"} (EFS)**  
The EFS encourages MOE schools to champion environmental ownership and a pro-environment mind-set amongst students and the community by leading and organising environmental initiatives. 

**[School Green Awards](https://sec.org.sg/our-programmes/environmental-awards/){:class="external-link" target="_blank"} (SGA)**
The SGA serves as a platform for students to develop and showcase their environmental efforts, through customised activities which will help them gain a better understanding of the environment.

		<p><i><strong>Grace Fu</strong></i><br/>
			<i>Minister for Sustainability and the Environment</i><br/><br/>
			Sustainability is about you and me, and the way we live. We aim to be a Zero Waste nation powered by a circular economy, with a high rate of recycling so that our precious resources can be used many times over.<br/><br/>
			We have already closed our water loop by recycling our used water to make NEWater.<br/><br/>
			We will turn incinerated waste into NEWSand, and use this for construction.<br/><br/>
			We will build up Singapore’s recycling capabilities, by sorting better and reducing contamination.<br/><br/>
			By 2030, we aim to reduce the waste sent to our landfill by 30%. We will frontload our efforts over the next 5 years to achieve a 20% reduction by 2026.<br/><br/>
			Let’s work together for a brighter and greener future.

	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p><i><strong>Ong Ye Kung</strong></i><br/>
			<i>Minister for Transport</i><br/><br/>
			By 2030, our MRT network will be comparable in coverage to major cities like London and New York City.<br/><br/> 
			We have announced plans to expand the cycling network. We will actively do more to repurpose roads, and implement pedestrianisation where possible.<br/><br/>
			We have declared our 2040 vision: to have all vehicles run on cleaner energy. To get there, we will require all newly registered cars to be cleaner-energy models by 2030.<br/><br/>
			We will more than double our EV charging point targets – from 28,000 to 60,000 by 2030. We will also revise the vehicle tax structure to make it easier to buy and to own EVs.<br/><br/>
			Having come from mudflats to a metropolis, we will turn our metropolis into a global city of sustainability.

	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p><i><strong>Lawrence Wong</strong></i><br/>
			<i>Minister for Education</i><br/><br/>
			We want every student to understand, live and practise sustainability.<br/><br/>
			We will start an Eco Stewardship Programme, involving all schools from Primary to Pre-U levels. As part of the Programme, we aim to reduce carbon emissions from the schools sector significantly.<br/><br/>
			We will get some of our schools to be carbon neutral by 2030, with the rest to follow thereafter.<br/><br/>
			We will also use the new Science Centre at Jurong Lake District to help bring lessons on sustainability to life.<br/><br/>
			We will help our students learn how to reduce their carbon footprint, make responsible decisions, and create a ripple effect on their families and friends.<br/><br/>
			This expands the scope of our Values-In-Action education with sustainability as a key part of the curriculum.
