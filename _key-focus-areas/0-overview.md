#### The Green Plan is a whole-of-nation sustainable development agenda, with firm action plans touching almost every dimension of our lives. 
<!-- This is an opportunity for us to be pioneers in technological and policy solutions for sustainable development. Singapore will be a living laboratory which other cities around the world can pick up ideas from. -->

Over the years, Singapore has spared no effort to drive sustainable development. From designating 2018 as the [Year of Climate Action](https://www.mse.gov.sg/resource-room/category/2018-12-14-newsletter-year-of-climate-action-key-initiatives/){:class="external-link" target="_blank"} to the annual [Climate Action Week](mse.gov.sg/resource-room/category/2020-08-14-press-release-on-singapore-climate-action-week/){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}, we have made significant progress in sustaining a green and liveable home for [future generations](https://www.singaporebudget.gov.sg/budget_2020/budget-speech/d-sustaining-singapores-success-for-our-future-generations){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}. In 2020, we started several initiatives, from the [Alliances for Action](https://www.mti.gov.sg/-/media/MTI/Newsroom/Press-Releases/2020/11/EST-Press-Release---19-Nov-2020.pdf){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}, to [Citizen Workgroups](https://www.mse.gov.sg/resource-room/category/2020-09-26-speech-on-reducing-excessive-consumption-of-disposables/){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}, as well as conversations and networks to [emerge stronger](https://emergingstronger.sg/){:class="external-link" target="_blank"} together with citizens, business, and [NGOs](https://www.towardszerowaste.gov.sg/green-groups-in-singapore/){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}.
