### Our Key Targets

The Green Plan is a whole-of-nation sustainable development agenda, with firm action plans touching almost every dimension of our lives. This is an opportunity for us to be pioneers in technological and policy solutions for sustainable development. Singapore will be a living laboratory which other cities around the world can pick up ideas from.

The Green Plan will cover the following: 
- Plant [1 million trees.](../city-in-nature/#:~:text=One%20million%20more%20trees%20will%20be%20planted%20across%20our%20island){:class="external-link"}
- [Quadruple](../energy-reset/#:~:text=Our%20solar%20energy%20deployment%20will%20quadruple%20by%202025){:class="external-link"} solar energy deployment by 2025.
- Become a [zero waste nation](../sustainable-living/#:~:text=zero%20waste%20nation){:class="external-link"}.
- Expand [cycling](../sustainable-living/#:~:text=green%20commutes){:class="external-link"} tracks to 1,320 km.  
- All [vehicles](../energy-reset/#:~:text=Transport){:class="external-link"} to run on cleaner energy by 2040.  
- Be a leader of the [green economy](../green-economy/){:class="external-link"}.  
- [Reduce the waste](../sustainable-living/#:~:text=Circular%20Economy){:class="external-link"} sent to our landfills by 30%. 
- Increase modal share of all the trips taken on [mass public transport](../energy-reset/#:~:text=Transport){:class="external-link"} from 64% to 75% by 2030. 
- More [schools](../sustainable-living/#:~:text=20%%20of%20schools%20to%20be%20carbon%20neutral%20by%202030){:class="external-link"} to be carbon neutral by 2030. 
- [Aviation](../energy-reset/#:~:text=Transport){:class="external-link"}: 3% improvement in fuel efficiency every year from now to 2050. 
- [Maritime](../energy-reset/#:~:text=Transport){:class="external-link"}: reduce greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping by at least 50% by 2050, compared to 2008 levels.
- Use 15% [less energy in HDB towns](../energy-reset/#:~:text=Housing){:class="external-link"} by 2030.
- [Green 80% of all buildings](../energy-reset/#:~:text=Housing){:class="external-link"} over the next decade.
- [Reduce domestic greenhouse emissions](../sustainable-living/#:~:text=reduce%caron%20emissions){:class="external-link"} by at least 3 million tonnes per year by 2030.
- Produce [30%](../resilient-future/#:~:text=30-by-30 target){:class="external-link"} of our nutritional needs by 2030 locally (30-by-30 target).
