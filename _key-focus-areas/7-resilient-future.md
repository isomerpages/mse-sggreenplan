- Against rising sea levels, we are developing new solutions and a better understanding of our coastlines.
- We will put in place the defences to protect our coastlines along East Coast, Lim Chu Kang, Sungei Kadut, and around Jurong Island. 
- Urban heat is all around us, for example, the kind that you feel while standing behind an air-conditioner. We will moderate rise in urban heat by increasing greenery and piloting the use of cool paint on building facades.
- Our **[30-by-30 target](https://www.sfa.gov.sg/food-farming){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}** aims to produce 30% of our nutritional needs by 2030 locally.

<!-- #### The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

- The Green Plan is very much aligned with the SDGs and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2030 Agenda) adopted by all countries at the United Nations in 2015. Our targets demonstrate Singapore's commitment to sutainable development, in sync with international efforts and the global agenda to build a more resilient future. -->
