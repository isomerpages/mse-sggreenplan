### City in Nature 

With challenges like climate change which bring about more extreme weather patterns and increasing urbanisation, we need to build a Singapore where residents will be able to enjoy a liveable, sustainable and climate resilient Singapore.
 
To do so, Singapore will be transformed into City in Nature. We will build upon what has been achieved and further restore nature into the urban environment.
Transforming Singapore into a City in Nature
 
To transform Singapore into a City in Nature, we are conserving and extending Singapore’s natural capital island-wide, and raising animal health and welfare standards in Singapore. We have five key strategies to achieve this vision:
 
- Expand the Nature Park Network
- Intensify nature in gardens and parks
- Restore nature into the urban landscape
- Strengthen connectivity between Singapore’s green spaces
- Enhance veterinary care and animal management
 
This will be underpinned by the support and involvement of the community.

	<ul>
	<li><strong>(New)</strong> Add over 130 hectares of new parks, and enhance around 170 hectares of existing parks with more lush vegetation and natural landscapes.
	</li>
	</ul>
</div>

- Set aside 1000 more hectares for green spaces by 2035, including 200 ha of new **[nature parks](https://www.mnd.gov.sg/our-work/greening-our-home/greenery){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}** by 2030
- Every household will live just a 10-minute walk from a park. 
- **[One million more trees](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/treessg/one-million-trees-movement){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}** will be planted across our island between 2020 and 2030, which will sequester another 78,000 tonnes of CO2, and provide cleaner air and more shade.
- Work with communities and NGOs to develop programmes to allow people and wildlife to live in harmony.
