</div>

<div style="background-color:#b2d4ce;">
	<ul>
	<li><strong>(New)</strong> Add over 130 hectares of new parks, and enhance around 170 hectares of existing parks with more lush vegetation and natural landscapes.
	</li>
	</ul>
</div>

- Set aside 1000 more hectares for green spaces by 2035, including 200 ha of new **[nature parks](https://www.mnd.gov.sg/our-work/greening-our-home/greenery){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}** by 2030
- Every household will live just a 10-minute walk from a park. 
- **[One million more trees](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/treessg/one-million-trees-movement){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}** will be planted across our island between 2020 and 2030, which will sequester another 78,000 tonnes of CO2, and provide cleaner air and more shade.
- Work with communities and NGOs to develop programmes to allow people and wildlife to live in harmony.
