- Every household will live just a 10-minute walk from a park. 
- One million more trees will be planted across our island, which will sequester another 78,000 tonnes of CO2, providing cleaner air and more shade.
- Working with communities and NGOs to develop programmes to allow people and wildlife to live in harmony.
