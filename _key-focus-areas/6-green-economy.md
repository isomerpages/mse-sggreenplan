Projected to be a multi-billion dollar industry, this includes green finance, sustainability consultancy, verification, credits trading and risk management. 

**[Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2025 Plan](https://www.nrf.gov.sg/rie2025-plan){:class="external-link" target="_blank"} (RIE2025)**  
We are promoting homegrown innovation under RIE 2025, and attracting companies to anchor their R&D activities in Singapore to develop new sustainability solutions in areas such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage, low-carbon hydrogen, energy efficient materials, and solutions for the circular economy, amongst others. Jurong Island will be a model for the adoption of such solutions as it transforms into a sustainable energy and chemicals park.

**Enterprise Sustainability Programme**  
This programme will help enterprises, especially SMEs, embrace sustainability and develop capabilities in this area.
