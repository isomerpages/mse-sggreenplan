### Energy Reset

#### We will use cleaner energy and increase our energy efficiency to lower our carbon footprint.

- Our solar energy deployment will quadruple by 2025, including covering the rooftops of HDB blocks with solar panels. By 2030, solar energy deployed will be five times that of today, with at least 2 gigawatt-peak, capable of powering over 350,000 households a year. 
- HDB towns will use 15% less energy through measures like the widespread use of smart LED lights and solar energy.
- Beyond HDB towns, we will green 80% of all buildings over the next decade.

- Our 2040 vision is to phase out internal combustion engine vehicles, and have all vehicles run on cleaner energy.
- All newly-registered cars to be cleaner-energy models by 2030.
- To support the growth of electric vehicles (EV), we will more than double our EV charging points targetâ€”from 28,000 to 60,000 by 2030.

<blockquote>
  <p>Depending on the results of our collective actions, and that of the international community, we will review our current carbon emission commitments, and seek to achieve net zero emissions as soon as we can. That way, we can punch above our weight, and have a positive environmental impact well beyond our shores.</p>
