### Over the years, Singapore has spared no effort in our mission for sustainable development.  
From designating 2018 as the [Year of Climate Action](https://www.mse.gov.sg/resource-room/category/2018-12-14-newsletter-year-of-climate-action-key-initiatives/){:class="external-link" target="_blank"} to our annual [Climate Action Week](mse.gov.sg/resource-room/category/2020-08-14-press-release-on-singapore-climate-action-week/){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}, we have made significant progress in sustaining our home for [future generations](https://www.singaporebudget.gov.sg/budget_2020/budget-speech/d-sustaining-singapores-success-for-our-future-generations){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}. In 2020, we started various initiatives, from the [Alliances for Action](https://www.mti.gov.sg/-/media/MTI/Newsroom/Press-Releases/2020/11/EST-Press-Release---19-Nov-2020.pdf){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}, to [Citizen Workgroups](https://www.mse.gov.sg/resource-room/category/2020-09-26-speech-on-reducing-excessive-consumption-of-disposables/){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}, as well as conversations and networks to [emerge stronger](https://emergingstronger.sg/){:class="external-link" target="_blank"} together with citizens, businesses, and [NGOs](https://www.towardszerowaste.gov.sg/green-groups-in-singapore/){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}. 

### Here is **what you can do** to be a Part of the Green Plan:

**Here are some ways you can contribute to the Green Plan - click on the links to learn more!**

- **[Adopt good personal habits](https://www.mse.gov.sg/take-action/individuals){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}**  
Being more sustainable starts with each and every one of us - there is no action too small. There are many easy ways to reduce waste and recycle in our daily lives to extend the life of our only landfill in Singapore and progress towards a zero waste nation.  
  

- **[Volunteer and participate](https://www.nea.gov.sg/programmes-grants/volunteering){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}**  
There are diverse opportunities to get involved with the community - from events that promote environmental awareness, to beautifying our common spaces and garnering support for ground-up projects.  
  

- **[Get funding using the SG Eco Fund](https://www.sgeco.gov.sg/){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}**  
*Have a idea or project you want to start? Why not get financial support and create more positive impact using our SG Eco Fund?  
<!-- - [Reduce water wastage](https://www.pub.gov.sg/savewater){:class="external-link" target="_blank"} and use water-efficient appliances -->
<!-- - [Reduce, Reuse and Recycle](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/waste-management/3r-programmes-and-resources/waste-minimisation-and-recycling){:class="external-link" target="_blank"} Right -->
<!-- - Buy, order, use only what you need -->
<!-- - [BYO bag, container](https://www.towardszerowaste.gov.sg/zero-waste-masterplan/chapter3/packaging/){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}, etc -->
<!-- - Repair/upcycle instead of buying new items  -->
<!-- - Switch off electrical appliances at the socket  
<!-- - Use a fan instead of the air-con, or set it at 25 degrees   -->
- **[Adopt an energy-efficient lifestyle](https://www.ema.gov.sg/industry-energy-efficiency.aspx){:class="external-link" target="_blank"} and use [energy-efficient appliances](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/climate-change-energy-efficiency/energy-efficiency/household-sector/the-energy-label){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}**  
Improving energy efficiency in households and industries is good for the environment. It is vital to energy conservation, which minimises energy wastages, and supports Singapore's aim to create a more sustainable, reliable and affordable energy future.  

  
- **[Take public transport, walk or cycle, instead of driving](https://www.mot.gov.sg/about-mot/land-transport/sustainable-transport){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}**  
Using cleaner transport options reduces our carbon footprint, and also keeps our air quality clean. If you need to drive, consider an electric vehivle (EV) when the COE expires.  
 
  
- **[Support local produce](https://www.sfa.gov.sg/food-farming/sgfoodstory/supporting-local-produce){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}**  
With increasing demand for food supply, and climate change causing rising temperatures, loss of arable land, and increased frequencies of erratic weather patterns, we need to ensure steady supplies of food here in Singapore.      
<!-- Grow edibles in own/community/allotment gardens, or participate in tree planting and habitat enhancement [programmes](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/treessg/one-million-trees-movement){:class="external-link" target="_blank"} organised by NParks. -->

<!-- Use [our resources](https://www.mse.gov.sg/resources/){:class="external-link" target="_blank"} to help you kickstart your own sustainability projects   -->
