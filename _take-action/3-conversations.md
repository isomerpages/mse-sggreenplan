<!-- # Green Plan Conversations -->

**We want to hear your views and insights on the Green Plan!**

Do you have views on the Singapore Green Plan 2030? Would you like share ideas on how we can co-create environmental solutions to build a Sustainable Singapore?

In the spirit of the Singapore Together movement, we want to work with Singaporeans and partners to learn from our collective experience and expertise, and to take action together. As part of this national engagement process, we will be organising a series of **Green Plan Conversations** helmed by the Ministers leading the Green Plan to hear your views on how we can build a city of green possibilities together, while taking into account Singapore's context.

The Conversations will include a presentation on the Green Plan, and both large-group and small-group sharing. It will be conducted virtually over Zoom.

We invite people from all walks of life to join us in these Conversations. However, we seek your understanding that there are limited spaces, and not everyone will be able to participate in this Conversation. Successful applicants will receive a confirmation email from us.

Here are upcoming Conversations that you can sign up for:

[24 April 2021, 2 – 5.30pm](https://www.form.gov.sg/#!/6035c9370e5974001185f2bf)
 
We invite you to register your interest for the inaugural Conversation, which will explore priorities for the Green Plan, and how we can realise the national sustainability agenda together. Pls indicate your interest by **19 April 2021**. For those who are unable to join the Conversation, we will be livestreaming the opening of the Conversation on [Minister Grace Fu’s Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/gracefu.hy), and welcome you to join us there.
