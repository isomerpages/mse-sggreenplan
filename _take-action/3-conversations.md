<!-- # Green Plan Conversations -->

**We want to hear your views and insights on the Green Plan!**

In the spirit of Singapore Together movement, we want to work with Singaporeans and partners to learn from our collective experience and expertise, and to take action together. As part of this national engagement process, we will be organising a series of Green Plan Conversations helmed by the Ministers leading the Green Plan to hear your views on the Green Plan, and how we can build a city of green possibilities together in Singapore's context.

The Conversations will include a presentation on the Green Plan, and both large-group and small-group sharing. It will be conducted virtually over Zoom.

We invite people from all walks of life to join us in these Conversations! However, we seek your understanding that there are limited spaces, and not everyone will be able to participate in this Conversation. We will send a confirmation email to those who have been selected for each Conversation.

Here are some upcoming Conversations that you can sign up for:

**24 April, 2.00pm – 5.30pm**

We invite you to register your interest for the inaugural Conversation, which will look at the Green Plan in its entirety. We want to hear your priorities in the Green Plan, and how we can realise the Green Plan together. Pls indicate your interest by **14 April**. For those who are unable to join the Conversation, we will livestream the opening of the Conversation on Minister Grace Fu’s Facebook page, and welcome you to join us there.
