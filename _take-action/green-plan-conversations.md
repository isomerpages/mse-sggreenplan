Do you have views on the Singapore Green Plan 2030? Would you like to converse with us and other like-minded stakeholders on how we can co-create environmental solutions to build a Sustainable Singapore?

The Green Plan is a living plan that will evolve as we take into account technological developments and engage a diverse range of stakeholders.

In the spirit of the Singapore Together movement, we want to work with Singaporeans and partners to learn from our collective experience and expertise, and to take action together.

As part of this national engagement process, we have been organising a series of Green Plan Conversations to hear your views on how we can build a city of green possibilities together, while taking into account Singapore's context.
