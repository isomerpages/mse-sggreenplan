Do you have views on the Singapore Green Plan 2030? Would you like to converse with us and other like-minded stakeholders on how we can co-create environmental solutions to build a Sustainable Singapore?

The Green Plan is a living plan that will evolve as we take into account technological developments and engage a diverse range of stakeholders.

In the spirit of the Singapore Together movement, we want to work with Singaporeans and partners to learn from our collective experience and expertise, and to take action together.

As part of this national engagement process, we have been organising a series of Green Plan Conversations to hear your views on how we can build a city of green possibilities together, while taking into account Singapore's context.

### Singapore Green Plan Conversation on Energy Reset (9 April 2022)
Senior Minister of State Amy Khor hosted MOT and LTA's third and final virtual Green Plan Conversation on 9 April 2022, focusing on the topic of electric vehicles (EVs) under the Energy Reset pillar. Close to 50 participants, comprising motorists, EV drivers, EV enthusiasts and public transport users shared their views and ideas about Singapore's EV transition, charging infrastructure and experience.

Participants explored attitudes and barriers to EV adoption, including the potential trade-offs and decision points. They candidly exchanged concerns on charging access and range anxiety, and also heard from those with EV experiences overseas. Participants further brainstormed on ways to foster gracious EV charging etiquette, such as incentivising moving vehicles at 80% charge, public education, facilitating time slot reservations, and having alerts and penalties for idle charging. Non-EV drivers also shared the importance of keeping electric public buses and PHC services affordable and accessible.

The green economy presents new opportunities for Singapore, and the Government will help existing sectors to transform and decarbonise. We will also grow new sectors and develop our workforce. In addition, we will take steps to use cleaner energy sources across all sectors, and transform the way we produce energy.
