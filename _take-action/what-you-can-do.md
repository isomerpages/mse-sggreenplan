### Over the years, Singapore has spared no effort in our mission for sustainable development.  
From designating 2018 as the [Year of Climate Action](https://www.mse.gov.sg/resource-room/category/2018-12-14-newsletter-year-of-climate-action-key-initiatives/){:class="external-link" target="_blank"} to our annual [Climate Action Week](https://mse.gov.sg/resource-room/category/2020-08-14-press-release-on-singapore-climate-action-week/){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}, we have made significant efforts to rally for collective action. In 2019, we convened [Citizens' Workgroups](https://www.mse.gov.sg/resource-room/category/2020-09-26-speech-on-reducing-excessive-consumption-of-disposables/){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}. In 2020, we started [Alliances for Action](https://www.mti.gov.sg/-/media/MTI/Newsroom/Press-Releases/2020/11/EST-Press-Release---19-Nov-2020.pdf){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}, as well as conversations on sustainability to [emerge stronger](https://emergingstronger.sg/){:class="external-link" target="_blank"} together with citizens, businesses, and [NGOs](https://www.towardszerowaste.gov.sg/green-groups-in-singapore/){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}. 

### Here is **what you can do** to be a Part of the Green Plan:

![What You Can Do](/images/greenplan/gp_individual.jpg)

**Here are some ways you can contribute to the Green Plan - click on the links to learn more!**

- **[Adopt good personal habits](https://www.mse.gov.sg/take-action/individuals){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}**  
Being more sustainable starts with each and every one of us - there is no action too small. There are many easy ways to reduce waste and recycle in our daily lives to extend the life of our only landfill in Singapore and progress towards a zero waste nation.  
  

- **[Volunteer and participate](https://www.nea.gov.sg/programmes-grants/volunteering){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}**  
There are diverse opportunities to get involved with the community - from events that promote environmental awareness, to ground-up projects, as well as [tree planting](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/treessg/one-million-trees-movement) and [conserving our natural heritage](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/biodiversity/community-in-nature-initiative).  
  

- **[Start your own project using the SG Eco Fund](https://www.sgeco.gov.sg/){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}**  
Have a idea or project you want to start? Try applying for financial support to create more positive impact with our SG Eco Fund.   
<!-- - [Reduce water wastage](https://www.pub.gov.sg/savewater){:class="external-link" target="_blank"} and use water-efficient appliances -->
<!-- - [Reduce, Reuse and Recycle](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/waste-management/3r-programmes-and-resources/waste-minimisation-and-recycling){:class="external-link" target="_blank"} Right -->
<!-- - Buy, order, use only what you need -->
<!-- - [BYO bag, container](https://www.towardszerowaste.gov.sg/zero-waste-masterplan/chapter3/packaging/){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}, etc -->
<!-- - Repair/upcycle instead of buying new items  -->
<!-- - Switch off electrical appliances at the socket  
<!-- - Use a fan instead of the air-con, or set it at 25 degrees   -->
- **[Adopt an energy-efficient lifestyle](https://www.ema.gov.sg/industry-energy-efficiency.aspx){:class="external-link" target="_blank"} and use [energy-efficient appliances](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/climate-change-energy-efficiency/energy-efficiency/household-sector/the-energy-label){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}**  
Improving energy efficiency in households and industries is good for the environment. Doing so conserves energy and supports Singapore's aim to create a more sustainable, reliable and affordable energy future.  

  
- **[Take public transport, walk or cycle, instead of driving](https://www.mot.gov.sg/about-mot/land-transport/sustainable-transport){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}**  
Using cleaner transport options reduces our carbon footprint, and also keeps our air quality clean. If you need to drive, consider an electric vehicle (EV) when the COE expires.  
 
  
- **[Support local produce](https://www.sfa.gov.sg/food-farming/sgfoodstory/supporting-local-produce){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}**  
By supporting local produce, in addition to boosting Singaporeâ€™s food security and economy, consumers can also making environmentally sustainable choices in their everyday food consumption. Local produce is safe, fresher and lasts longer. Local produce also results in less spoilage, food waste, and a lower carbon footprint, as the produce does not need to travel for long periods of time before reaching the consumer.
