### Our Key Targets for the Green Plan
Singapore Green Plan 2030 charts ambitious and concrete targets to advance Singapore’s national agenda on sustainable development. The five key pillars under the Green Plan encompass targets that touch almost every dimension of our lives.

#### City in Nature 

2026 target:
- Develop over 130 ha of new parks, and enhance around 170 ha of existing parks with more lush vegetation and natural landscapes.

2030 targets:
- Double our annual tree planting rate between 2020 and 2030, to plant 1 million more trees across Singapore
- Increase nature parks’ land area by over 50% from 2020 baseline
- Every household will be within a 10-minute walk from a park

2035 target:
- Add 1000 ha of green spaces

### Sustainable Living

**A Green Citizenry that Consumes and Wastes Less**

2026 target:
- Reduce the amount of waste to landfill per capita per day by 20%

2030 targets:
- Reduce household water consumption to 130 litres per capita per day
- Reduce the amount of waste to landfill per capita per day by 30%

**Green Commutes**

2030 targets:
- Achieve 75% mass public transport (i.e. rail and bus) peak-period modal share
- Expand rail network from around 230km today to 360km by early 2030s
- Triple cycling paths to 1,320km from 460km in 2020

**Strengthen Green Efforts in Schools**

2030 targets:
- Achieve a two-thirds reduction of net carbon emissions from the schools sector
- At least 20% of schools to be carbon neutral

### Energy Reset

**Green Energy**

Play active and important roles in fulfilling two international goals

- The International Civil Aviation Organization’s aspirational goals of 2% annual fuel efficiency improvement from now to 2050 and carbon neutral growth from 2020
- The International Maritime Organization’s target to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from international shipping by at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008 levels, and to phase out such GHG emissions in this century

2030 targets:
- Increase solar energy deployment by five-fold to at least 2 GWp, which can meet around 3% of our 2030 projected electricity demand and generate enough electricity to power more than 350,000 households a year (1.5 GWp by 2025, which can meet around 2% of our 2025 projected electricity demand and generate enough electricity to power more than 260,000 households a year)
- 200 MW of energy storage systems deployment beyond 2025, which can power more than 16,000 households a day
- Best-in-class generation technology that meets heat-rate/emissions standards and reduces carbon emissions
- Diversified electricity supply with clean electricity imports

**Greener Infrastructure and Buildings**

2025 target:

- Reduce energy consumption of desalination process from current 3.5kWh/m<sup>3</sup> to 2kWh/m<sup>3</sup>
- Singapore’s first integrated waste and used water treatment facility to be 100% energy self-sufficient (Tuas Nexus)

2030 targets:

- Green 80% of Singapore’s buildings (by Gross Floor Area) by 2030
- 80% of new buildings (by Gross Floor Area) to be Super Low Energy buildings from 2030
- Best-in-class green buildings to see an 80% improvement in energy efficiency (over 2005 levels) by 2030
Long-term target: Reduce desalination energy further to 1kWh/m<sup>3</sup>

**Sustainable Towns and Districts**

2030 target:
- Reduce energy consumption in existing HDB towns by 15%

**Cleaner-energy Vehicles**

2025 targets:
- New registrations of diesel cars and taxis to cease from 2025
- 8 EV-Ready Towns with chargers at all HDB carparks by 2025

2030 targets:
- All new car and taxi registrations to be of cleaner-energy models from 2030
- Target 60,000 charging points nationwide by 2030, including 40,000 in public carparks and 20,000 in - private premises

### Green Economy 

**New Investments to be Among the Best-in-Class**

Seek new investments to be among the best-in-class in energy/ carbon efficiency

**Sustainability as a New Engine for Jobs and Growth**

2030 targets:
- Jurong Island to be a sustainable energy and chemicals park
- Singapore as a sustainable tourism destination
- Singapore as a leading centre for green finance and services to facilitate Asia’s transition to a low-carbon and sustainable future
- Singapore as a carbon services hub in Asia
- Singapore as a leading regional centre for developing new sustainability solutions
- Groom a strong pool of local enterprises to capture sustainability opportunities

### Resilient Future

**Adapt to Sea-level Rise and Enhance Flood Resilience**

2030 target:
- Complete formulation of coastal protection plans for City-East Coast, North-West Coast (Lim Chu Kang and Sungei Kadut) and Jurong Island

**Grow Local**

2030 target:
- Meet 30% of Singapore’s nutritional needs through locally produced food
