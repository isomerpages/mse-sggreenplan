### Our Key Targets for the Green Plan
Singapore Green Plan 2030 charts ambitious and concrete targets to advance Singapore’s national agenda on sustainable development. The five key pillars under the Green Plan encompass targets that touch almost every dimension of our lives.

#### City in Nature 

2026 targets:
- Develop over 130 ha of new parks, and enhance around 170 ha of existing parks with more lush vegetation and natural landscapes.

2030 targets:
- Double our annual tree planting rate between 2020 and 2030, to plant 1 million more trees across Singapore
- Increase nature parks’ land area by over 50% from 2020 baseline
- Every household will be within a 10-minute walk from a park

2035 targets:
- Add 1000 ha of green spaces

### Sustainable Living

**A Green Citizenry that Consumes and Wastes Less**

2026 targets:
- Reduce the amount of waste to landfill per capita per day by 20%

2030 targets:
- Reduce household water consumption to 130 litres per capita per day
- Reduce the amount of waste to landfill per capita per day by 30%

**Green Commutes**

2030 targets:
- Achieve 75% mass public transport (i.e. rail and bus) peak-period modal share
- Electric buses to make up half of the public bus fleet by 2030. Existing diesel buses will be replaced with cleaner energy buses by 2040.
- Expand rail network to 360km by early 2030s
- Expand cycling path networks to around 1,300km

2040 targets:
- Achieve more than 80% mass public transport (i.e. rail and bus) peak-period modal share
- Public, active and shared transport modes to account for 9 in 10 of all peak-period journeys

**Strengthen Green Efforts in Schools**

2030 targets:
- Achieve a two-thirds reduction of net carbon emissions from the schools sector
- At least 20% of schools to be carbon neutral

### Energy Reset

**Green Energy**

Play active and important roles in contributing towards two international goals

- The International Civil Aviation Organization’s long-term global aspirational goal (LTAG) for international aviation to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050.
- The International Maritime Organization’s target to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from international shipping by at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008 levels, and to phase out such GHG emissions in this century

2025 targets:
- 1.5 gigawatt-peak of solar energy deployment, which can meet around 2% of our 2025 projected electricity demands, and generate enough electricity to meet the annual electricity needs of around 260,000 households
- Deploy 200 megawatt-hour of Energy Storage Systems to enhance grid resilience and support clean energy transitions [Achieved in December 2022] 

2030 targets:
- Increase solar energy deployment to at least 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp), which can meet around 3% of our 2030 projected electricity demand and generate enough electricity to meet the annual electricity needs of around 350,000 households
- Best-in-class power generation technology that meets emission standards and reduces carbon emissions

**Greener Infrastructure and Buildings**

2025 targets:

- Reduce energy consumption of desalination process from current 3.5kWh/m<sup>3</sup> to 2kWh/m<sup>3</sup>
- Singapore’s first integrated waste and used water treatment facility to be 100% energy self-sufficient (Tuas Nexus)

2030 targets:

- Green 80% of Singapore’s buildings (by Gross Floor Area) by 2030
- 80% of new buildings (by Gross Floor Area) to be Super Low Energy buildings from 2030
- Best-in-class green buildings to see an 80% improvement in energy efficiency (over 2005 levels) by 2030
Long-term target: Reduce desalination energy further to 1kWh/m<sup>3</sup>

**Sustainable Towns and Districts**

2030 targets:
- Reduce energy consumption in existing HDB towns by 15%

**Cleaner-energy Vehicles**

2025 targets:
- New registrations of diesel cars and taxis to cease from 2025
- All HDB towns to be Electric Vehicle (EV) ready with chargers at all HDB carparks by 2025

2030 targets:
- All new car and taxi registrations to be of cleaner-energy models from 2030
- Deploy 60,000 EV charging points nationwide by 2030

2040 targets:
- All vehicles to run on cleaner energy by 2040

**Sustainable Aviation**

2025 targets:
- All new airside light vehicles, forklifts and tractors at Changi Airport to be electric from 2025

2040 targets:
- All airside vehicles at Changi Airport to run on cleaner energy by 2040

**Sustainable Maritime**

2030 targets:
- All new harbour craft operating in our port waters to be fully electric, be capable of using B100 biofuels, or be compatible with net zero fuels from 2030

### Green Economy 

**New Investments to be Among the Best-in-Class**

Seek new investments to be among the best-in-class in energy/ carbon efficiency

**Sustainability as a New Engine for Jobs and Growth**

2030 targets:
- Jurong Island to be a sustainable energy and chemicals park
- Singapore as a sustainable tourism destination
- Singapore as a leading centre for green finance and services to facilitate Asia’s transition to a low-carbon and sustainable future
- Singapore as a carbon services hub in Asia
- Singapore as a leading regional centre for developing new sustainability solutions
- Groom a strong pool of local enterprises to capture sustainability opportunities

### Resilient Future

**Adapt to Sea-level Rise and Enhance Flood Resilience**

2030 targets:
- Complete formulation of coastal protection plans for City-East Coast, North-West Coast (Lim Chu Kang and Sungei Kadut) and Jurong Island

**Grow Local**

2030 targets:
- Build the capability and capacity of our agri-food industry to produce 30% of Singapore's nutritional needs locally and sustainably
