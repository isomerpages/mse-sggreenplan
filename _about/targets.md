### Our Key Targets for the Green Plan

### City in Nature 

#### 2026 target:
- Develop over 130 ha of new parks, and enhance around 170 ha of existing parks with more lush vegetation and natural landscapes.

#### 2030 targets:
- Double our annual tree planting rate between 2020 and 2030, to plant 1 million more trees across Singapore
- Increase nature parks’ land area by over 50% from 2020 baseline
- Every household will be within a 10-minute walk from a park

#### 2035 target:
- Add 1000 ha of green spaces


### Sustainable Living

### A Green Citizenry that Consumes and Wastes Less

#### 2026 target:
- Reduce the amount of waste to landfill per capita per day by 20%

#### 2030 targets:
- Reduce household water consumption to 130 litres per capita per day
- Reduce the amount of waste to landfill per capita per day by 30%

### Green Commutes

#### 2030 targets:
- Achieve 75% mass public transport (i.e. rail and bus) peak-period modal share
- Expand rail network from around 230km today to 360km by early 2030s
- Triple cycling paths to 1,320km from 460km in 2020

### Strengthen Green Efforts in Schools

#### 2030 targets:
- Achieve a two-thirds reduction of net carbon emissions from the schools sector
- At least 20% of schools to be carbon neutral


### Energy Reset

### Green Energy

#### Play active and important roles in fulfilling two international goals

- The International Civil Aviation Organization’s aspirational goals of 2% annual fuel efficiency improvement from now to 2050 and carbon neutral growth from 2020
- The International Maritime Organization’s target to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from international shipping by at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008 levels, and to phase out such GHG emissions in this century

#### 2030 targets:
- Increase solar energy deployment by five-fold to at least 2 GWp, which can meet around 3% of our 2030 projected electricity demand and generate enough electricity to power more than 350,000 households a year (1.5 GWp by 2025, which can meet around 2% of our 2025 projected electricity demand and generate enough electricity to power more than 260,000 households a year)
- 200 MW of energy storage systems deployment beyond 2025, which can power more than 16,000 households a day
- Best-in-class generation technology that meets heat-rate/emissions standards and reduces carbon emissions
- Diversified electricity supply with clean electricity imports

#### Greener Infrastructure and Buildings

#### 2025 targets:
- Reduce energy consumption of desalination process from current 3.5kWh/m3 to 2kWh/m3
- Singapore’s first integrated waste and used water treatment facility to be 100% energy self-sufficient (Tuas Nexus)

#### 2030 targets:
- Green 80% of Singapore’s buildings (by Gross Floor Area) by 2030
- 80% of new buildings (by Gross Floor Area) to be SLE buildings from 2030
- Best-in-class green buildings to see an 80% improvement in energy efficiency (over 2005 levels) by 2030

Long-term target: Reduce desalination energy further to 1kWh/m3


### Sustainable Towns and Districts

#### 2030 target:
- Reduce energy consumption in existing HDB towns by 15%


### Cleaner-energy Vehicles

#### 2025 targets:
- New registrations of diesel cars and taxis to cease from 2025- 
- 7 EV-Ready Towns with chargers at all HDB carparks by 2025

#### 2030 targets:
- All new car and taxi registrations to be of cleaner-energy models from 2030
- Target 60,000 charging points nationwide by 2030, including 40,000 in public carparks and 20,000 in - private premises

### Green Economy 

### New Investments to be Among the Best-in-Class
Seek new investments to be among the best-in-class in energy/ carbon efficiency

### Sustainability as a New Engine for Jobs and Growth
#### 2030 targets:
- Jurong Island to be a sustainable energy and chemicals park
- Singapore as a sustainable tourism destination
- Singapore as a leading centre for green finance and services to facilitate Asia’s transition to a low-carbon and sustainable future
- Singapore as a carbon services hub in Asia
- Singapore as a leading regional centre for developing new sustainability solutions
- Groom a strong pool of local enterprises to capture sustainability opportunities


### Resilient Future

### Adapt to Sea-level Rise and Enhance Flood Resilience
#### 2030 targets:
- Complete formulation of coastal protection plans for City-East Coast, North-West Coast (Lim Chu Kang and Sungei Kadut) and Jurong Island

### Grow Local
#### 2030 targets:
- Meet 30% of Singapore’s nutritional needs through locally produced food
