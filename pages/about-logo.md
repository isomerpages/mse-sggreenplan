**The Singapore Green Plan Logo is adapted from the ‘Singapore Mark’ - the widely-recognisable red emblem of Singapore.**  

**The colour of the Singapore Mark has been changed from our national red to green to signal our determination and collective commitment to make Singapore a global city of sustainability.**
