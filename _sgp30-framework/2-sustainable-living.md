### Sustainable Living

Sustainability is about us, and the way we live. From water to waste, we will become a circular economy, with a high rate of recycling and reuse. 

A Circular Economy
- Water consumption per household will be further reduced by 10% to 130 litres per capita per day.
- Incinerated waste will be turned into [NEWSand](https://www.nea.gov.sg/media/news/news/index/newsand-a-key-to-closing-singapore-waste-loop){:target="_blank"}, and used to surface roads.
- A Good Samaritan law will be introduced to promote food redistribution.
- [Waste-to-landfill](https://www.towardszerowaste.sg/zero-waste-nation/){:target="_blank"} will be reduced by 30%, achieving a 20% reduction by 2026.

Public Transport
- Our MRT network will be comparable in coverage to major cities like London and New York City.
- New town concepts, such as [Tengah](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/about-us/history/hdb-towns-your-home/tengah){:target="_blank"}, will have the first car-free HDB town centre, with roads constructed underground, freeing up surface spaces for public transport, activities, and green spaces.
- The cycling network will be expanded from 460 km today to around 1,3020 km by 2030.
