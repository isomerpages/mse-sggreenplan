Our aim is to be a leading centre for Green Finance in Asia and globally.

- We will build up the financial sectorâ€™s resilience to environmental risks, develop green finance solutions and markets, build knowledge and capabilities, and leverage innovation and technology.  
- Home-grown innovation will be promoted under the Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE2025) ecosystem, and attract companies to anchor their R&D activities in Singapore to develop new sustainability solutions for Asia and the world.
- The Enterprise Sustainability Programme will help enterprises, especially SMEs, embrace sustainability and develop capabilities in this area.
