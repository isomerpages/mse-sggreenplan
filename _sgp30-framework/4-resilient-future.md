### Resilient Future

#### Staying Nimble and Adaptable 

Our campaign to deal with climate change will continue into the next century, and our efforts have already begunâ€“from physical defences protecting our coastlines from rising sea levels, to increasing local food production. 

- Against rising sea levels, we are developing new solutions and better understanding of our coastlines.
- We will put in place the physical defences to protect our coastlines along East Coast, around Lim Chu Kang, Sungei Kadut, and Jurong Island. 
- Urban heat is all around us, for example, the kind that you feel while standing behind an air-conditioner. We will moderate rise in urban heat by increasing greenery and piloting the use of cool paint on building facades.
- Our [30-by-30 target](https://www.sfa.gov.sg/food-farming){:target="_blank"} aims for sustainable production of 30% of our nutritional needs by 2030 locally.
