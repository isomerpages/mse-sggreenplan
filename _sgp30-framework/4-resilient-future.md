### Resilient Future

#### Staying Nimble and Adaptable 

Our campaign to deal with climate change will continue into the next century, and our efforts have already begunâ€“from physical defences protecting our coastlines from rising sea levels, to increasing local food production. 

- Against rising sea levels, we are developing new solutions and better understanding of our coastlines.
- We will put in place the physical defences to protect our coastlines along City-East Coast, around Lim Chu Kang, Sungei Kadut, and Jurong Island. 
- Temperature rise in Singapore will be moderated through a science-based roadmap to mitigate the Urban Heat Island effect.
- Besides increasing greenery, we will pilot the use of cool materials.
- Our [30-by-30 target](https://www.sfa.gov.sg/food-farming){:target="_blank"} aims for sustainable production of 30% of our nutritional needs by 2030 locally.
