### City in Nature

#### Greenery for All

Singapore will be an even greener and beautiful City in Nature, with every household living just a 10-minute walk away from a park.

- By 2030, we will set aside 50% more land—around 200 hectares — for [nature parks](https://www.mnd.gov.sg/our-work/greening-our-home/greenery){:target="_blank"}.
- We will plant one million more trees across our island, which will sequester another 78,000 tonnes of CO2.
