<h4>The Green Plan is a living plan that will evolve as we consider technological developments and engage a diverse range of stakeholders. <strong>Green Citizenry</strong> is one of the key enablers for this whole-of-nation movement to tackle climate change.</h4>
<p></p>
<p>Climate action cannot be achieved by the Government alone. We encourage
citizens and businesses to adopt sustainable practices and engage in climate
conversations, as Government ministries and agencies take the lead in adopting
sustainable actions.</p>
<p>The Government is committed to working with Singaporeans and partners
to co-deliver and co-create solutions for a more sustainable Singapore.</p>
