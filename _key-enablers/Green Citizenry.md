<h3>The Green Plan is a living plan that will evolve as we consider technological developments and engage a diverse range of stakeholders. <strong>Green Citizenry</strong> is one of the key enablers for this whole-of-nation movement to tackle climate change.</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Climate action cannot be achieved by the Government alone. We encourage
citizens and businesses to adopt sustainable practices and engage in climate
conversations, as Government ministries and agencies take the lead in adopting
sustainable actions.</p>
The Government is committed to working with Singaporeans and partners
to co-deliver and co-create solutions for a more sustainable Singapore.

They exchanged their perspectives of EVs, and discussed potential recommendations to cultivate good charging behaviour to enhance the overall EV experience.</p>

<h5>Go Green SG</h5>

<p>In 2023, MSE launched the inaugural <a href="https://www.gogreen.gov.sg/">Go Green SG</a> campaign, a nation-wide month-long sustainability movement to rally citizens, organisations, and the community to take collective action towards a more environmentally sustainable and climate-resilient Singapore. MSE worked closely with 3P (People, Public, Private) partners, MSE’s Statutory Boards, and other government agencies including STB, MOE, NLB, NParks and LTA to curate a unique, attractive slate of sustainability-related activities catering to different interests.

The activities allowed participants to appreciate Singapore’s sustainability efforts first-hand, and nudged them to adopt a more sustainable lifestyle. In the spirit of 3P partnership, Go Green SG saw over 70,000 people take part in more than 300 activities organised by 160 partners.</p>

<h4><u>Partnerships and Funding</u></h4>
<h5>Singapore Government Partnerships Office (SGPO)</h5>
<p>The SGPO was officially launched by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Lawrence Wong on 19 Jan 2024 to strengthen the Government’s partnerships and engagements with citizens.</p>

<h5>Green Action for Communities (GAC)</h5>
<p>The GAC movement, established in 2022, aims to enable and empower community action in environmental sustainability. It brings together community leaders, residents, and Government agencies to plan, organise, and co-implement sustainability initiatives in their local communities.</p>
Over 200 projects have been proposed by the GAC groups, including recycling initiatives and community gardens. A <a href="https://file.go.gov.sg/gac.pdf">Guidebook</a> was also created to guide the community by informing them about potential initiatives and resources.
<h5>SG Eco Fund</h5>
<p> $50 million <a href="https://www.mse.gov.sg/sgecofund/">SG Eco Fund</a>was set up in 2020 to support projects that advance environmental sustainability and involve the community.</p>
Through the SG Eco Fund, we hope to enable our community to build a sustainable Singapore for both present and future generations.<p></p>
