### Green Economy

![Green Economy](/images/framework/framework_greeneconomy.jpg)

The **Green Economy** is where we will seek green growth to create new jobs, transform our industries and harness sustainability as a competitive advantage.

We can be a leading carbon trading and services hub, which is projected to be a multi-billion dollar industry. We will also create new and diverse job opportunities in sectors such as green finance, sustainability consultancy, verification, credits trading and risk management.

**Enterprise Sustainability Programme**  
The ESP **will help enterprises, especially SMEs, embrace sustainability and develop capabilities in this area**. We will build up the financial sectorâ€™s resilience to environmental risks, develop green finance solutions and markets, build knowledge and capabilities, and leverage innovation and technology.  

**[Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2025](https://www.nrf.gov.sg/rie2025-plan){:class="external-link" target="_blank"} (RIE2025)**  
Homegrown innovation will be promoted under the RIE2025 Plan, and attract companies to anchor their R&D activities in Singapore to develop new sustainability solutions for Asia and the world.

**[The Jurong Island Economy Study](https://www.towardszerowaste.gov.sg/zero-waste-masterplan/chapter2/sustainable-production/){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}**  
The study seeks to bring about environmental and economic gains for companies by mapping out the current water, energy, and waste flows on Jurong Island, and to identify further synergies and reduce resource use at the systems level.

**Do you have ideas or suggestions on the Green Plan?**
