### Energy Reset

Our **Energy Reset** will see Singapore using cleaner energy and increase our energy efficiency to lower our carbon footprint. 

**[Housing](https://www.mnd.gov.sg/our-work/greening-our-home/hdb-green-towns-programme){:class="external-link" target="_blank"}**
- Our solar energy deployment will quadruple by 2025, including covering the rooftops of HDB blocks with solar panels. By 2030, solar energy deployed will be five times that of today, with at least 2 gigawatt-peak, capable of powering over 350,000 households a year. 
- HDB towns will use 15% less energy through measures like the widespread use of smart LED lights and solar energy.
- Beyond HDB towns, we will green 80% of all buildings over the next decade.

- Our 2040 vision is to phase out internal combustion engine vehicles, and have all vehicles run on cleaner energy.
- To support the growth of electric vehicles (EV), we will more than double our EV charger targetsâ€”from 28,000 to 60,000 by 2030.

**Do you have ideas or suggestions on the Green Plan?**
