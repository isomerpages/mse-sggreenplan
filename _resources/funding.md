# For Communities, Schools, Businesses

#### SG Eco Fund
The S$50 million [SG Eco Fund](https://www.mse.gov.sg/sgecofund/) was launched in November 2020 by the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment to support the co-creation of solutions for a sustainable Singapore. The Fund is open to the People, Private and Public (3P) sectors and aims to support ground-up projects that involve the community and advance environmental sustainability in Singapore. Projects across a broad range of areas related to sustainability, including climate change mitigation, waste reduction, as well as the conservation of nature and biodiversity, are supported. 

#### 3R Fund
The [3R Fund](https://www.nea.gov.sg/programmes-grants/grants-and-awards/3r-fund) is a co-funding scheme to encourage organisations to reduce waste disposed of at NEA's incineration plants and disposal facilities through the implementation of waste minimisation and recycling projects.

#### Call for Ideas Fund
The [Call for Ideas Fund](https://www.nea.gov.sg/programmes-grants/grants-and-awards/call-for-ideas-fund) aims to help applicants kickstart projects that seek to resolve an environmental challenge in the local community. These projects should seek to encourage the community to make environmentally responsible choices through outreach and education efforts.
